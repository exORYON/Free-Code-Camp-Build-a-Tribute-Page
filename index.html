      <p>
        SpaceX is developing Starship to carry people and cargo to the moon, Mars and other distant destinations. The
        system consists of two elements: a stainless-steel spacecraft called Starship, which will sport six Raptors, and a
        giant rocket known as Super Heavy, which will have about 30 of the engines.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Both of these vehicles will be fully and rapidly reusable, Musk has said. Starship will be capable of making many
        trips from Earth to Mars and back, and each Super Heavy will rack up many launches during its life. Starship will
        be powerful enough to launch itself off the moon and Mars, but it will need Super Heavy to get off our
        massive Earth.
